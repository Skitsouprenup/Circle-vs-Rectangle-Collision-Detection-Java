# Circle-vs-Rectangle-Collision-Detection-Java
Rectangle-to-circle or circle-to-rectangle collision detection algorithm.

This project is explained in this tutorial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIjZuCYy2ys

I expect viewers to have an understanding about rectangle vs rectangle collision, AABB(Axis Aligned Bounding Box) and circle vs point collision.
The algorithms that are used in this project only work for axis-aligned rectangle or a rectangle that is not rotated.

The 'Complete' directory contains UI codes and collision algorithms. The 'Setup' directory contains UI codes and doesn't contain circle-to-rectangle collision response algorithm. Use the files in 'Complete' folder for your reference and use files in 'Setup' folder if you wanna follow my tutorial that I mentioned above.
